                    An Example of a json web token is xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxx It have 3 parts. header, payload and signature part. Typically, a private key, or secret, is used by the issuer to sign the JWT. The receiver of the JWT will verify the signature to ensure that the token hasn't been altered after it was signed by the issuer. It is difficult for unauthenticated sources to guess the signing key and attempt to change the claims within the JWT.
